# HSE_Thesis
This repository contains notebooks with code for the most successful experiments conducted during the process of working on the thesis about LLMs in exploratory search field. The experiments are separated into different notebook for convenience:
* Thesis_fin_(RuBERT) is a RuBERT notebook;
* Thesis_fin_(XLM-RoBERTa) is for RoBERTa;
* Thesis_fin_(T5) is for T5.
All experiments are the same (fine-tunung, augmentation, working with PDF files), but some functions may differ because of the models' different structures and requirements.
